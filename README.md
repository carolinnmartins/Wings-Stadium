# Wings-Stadium

Wings Stadium was my final project for the Code First Girls course to demonstrate the skills acquired in SQL and Data.

I created an event and ticketing system thinking as a project manager, responsible for business analysis and business improvement. 

This project aims to answer business questions such as:
- Sales forecast and earnings by event;
- Events with highest/lowest affluence?
- Most lucrative seats? And sectors?
- Sales per client, country and/or partner; 
- Ticket detailed information;


To be able to set the relationships in data, I create an EER diagram with 11 tables, such as clients, country, seats, sectors, category, partners, events, artist, artist_event, tickets and ticket_sales
